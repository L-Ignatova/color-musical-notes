# Notes coloring
 This little app visualizes the musical notes of popular lullaby "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" by Jane Taylor using colors. Currently, the beats are hard-coded so the transitions fit the melody.

 ## To improve
 Transitions can be automated instead of hard-coded

 ## Deployment
 This app was deployed on [AWS](http://play-with-twinkle.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/).
